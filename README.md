# SVELTE PRACTICE APPLICATION
---

# This is a feedback rating application in Svelte


```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Dowload zip file or Clone repo*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
